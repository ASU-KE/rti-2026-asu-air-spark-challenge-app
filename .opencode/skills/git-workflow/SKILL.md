# Git Workflow Patterns

For Git configuration, aliases, ignore rules, and hooks, see [`CONFIG-AND-HOOKS.md`](CONFIG-AND-HOOKS.md). For semantic versioning, tags, and changelogs, see [`RELEASES.md`](RELEASES.md).

## Delivery Pipeline: slice → review → small PR

How a `to-tickets` vertical slice reaches `main`. The rule is **one slice, one short-lived branch, one small PR** — readability by a human reviewer is the bar, and it outranks batching for speed. No monolithic PRs.

1. **Branch per slice.** Cut `feature/<issue>-<slug>` from `main` (GitHub Flow, below). A slice is sized to one fresh context window (`to-tickets`), so its branch lives a day or two, not weeks.
2. **Atomic commits track the red → green loop.** Each commit is one coherent step that builds and passes on its own (`tdd`): the failing `test:`, the `feat:`/`fix:` that greens it, an optional `refactor:`. One logical change per commit — never fold a refactor into a feature. Atomic commits let a reviewer read the slice as a story.
3. **Two review gates before the PR is ready.** Once the slice is green, run `/code-review` (Standards + Spec), then `/security-review` when the slice touches auth, secrets, input boundaries, or data access (skip only when none apply, and say so). Clear blockers before requesting human review. CI must be green before requesting human review (advisory — no required status checks). Pushes dismiss approvals, so request review on the final push.
4. **Open one small PR to `main`.** Keep the diff readable in a single sitting — ≤300 lines of code and tests; if it grows past that, the slice was too big, so split it via `/to-tickets`. Fill the PR template below, link the ticket, and require green CI (tests, lint, typecheck). Manage the PR with `github-ops`.
5. **Merge and delete the branch.** Keep the atomic history when each commit stands alone; the `main` ruleset allows merge commits only, so squash is not an option. Deploy from `main`.

**Integration branch — only when a slice can't stay green alone.** The default is slice → PR → `main`. When `to-tickets` sequenced batches that promise green only together (a wide refactor's expand–contract, or slices that must assemble before end-to-end coverage is meaningful), point those PRs at a shared integration branch instead of `main`, run the full Playwright suite there (`e2e-testing`), and merge the integration branch to `main` in one reviewed PR once green. This keeps `main` deployable while still allowing e2e across the assembled slices.

## Branching Strategies

### GitHub Flow (Simple, Recommended for Most)

Best for continuous deployment and small-to-medium teams.

```
main (protected, always deployable)
  │
  ├── feature/user-auth      → PR → merge to main
  ├── feature/payment-flow   → PR → merge to main
  └── fix/login-bug          → PR → merge to main
```

**Rules:**
- `main` is always deployable
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Open Pull Request when ready for review
 - After 1 human approval (author/agent cannot self-approve), merge to `main` using a merge commit (squash and rebase merges disabled); no force-push; no branch deletion; org admins may bypass
- Deploy immediately after merge

### Trunk-Based Development (High-Velocity Teams)

Best for teams with strong CI/CD and feature flags.

```
main (trunk)
  │
  ├── short-lived feature (1-2 days max)
  ├── short-lived feature
  └── short-lived feature
```

**Rules:**
- Everyone commits to `main` or very short-lived branches
- Feature flags hide incomplete work
- CI must pass before merge
- Deploy multiple times per day

### GitFlow (Complex, Release-Cycle Driven)

Best for scheduled releases and enterprise projects.

```
main (production releases)
  │
  └── develop (integration branch)
        │
        ├── feature/user-auth
        ├── feature/payment
        │
        ├── release/1.0.0    → merge to main and develop
        │
        └── hotfix/critical  → merge to main and develop
```

**Rules:**
- `main` contains production-ready code only
- `develop` is the integration branch
- Feature branches from `develop`, merge back to `develop`
- Release branches from `develop`, merge to `main` and `develop`
- Hotfix branches from `main`, merge to both `main` and `develop`

### When to Use Which

| Strategy | Team Size | Release Cadence | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| GitHub Flow | Any | Continuous | SaaS, web apps, startups |
| Trunk-Based | 5+ experienced | Multiple/day | High-velocity teams, feature flags |
| GitFlow | 10+ | Scheduled | Enterprise, regulated industries |

## Commit Messages

### Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): update installation instructions` |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change | `style: fix indentation in login component` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | `refactor(db): extract connection pool to module` |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | `test(auth): add unit tests for token validation` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(query): add index to users table` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: add PostgreSQL service to test workflow` |
| `revert` | Revert previous commit | `revert: revert "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login"` |

### Write a specific subject, and a body that explains why

Imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars in the subject; use the body for the reasoning a diff cannot show.

```
# GOOD: specific subject, body explains why
git commit -m "fix(api): retry requests on 503 Service Unavailable

The external API occasionally returns 503 errors during peak hours.
Added exponential backoff retry logic with max 3 attempts.

Closes #123"

# BAD: vague, no context
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

### Commit Message Template

Create `.gitmessage` in repo root:

```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# # Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, revert
# Scope: api, ui, db, auth, etc.
# Subject: imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars
#
# [optional body] - explain why, not what
# [optional footer] - Breaking changes, closes #issue
```

Enable with: `git config commit.template .gitmessage`

### AI-Assisted Commits

AI-assisted commits include a `Co-authored-by:` trailer naming the harness and model (e.g. `Co-authored-by: OpenCode <model>`). Record the actual model used — do not guess.

## Merge vs Rebase

### Merge (Preserves History)

```bash
# Creates a merge commit
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth

# Result:
# *   merge commit
# |\
# | * feature commits
# |/
# * main commits
```

**Use when:**
- Merging feature branches into `main`
- You want to preserve exact history
- Multiple people worked on the branch
- The branch has been pushed and others may have based work on it

### Rebase (Linear History)

```bash
# Rewrites feature commits onto target branch
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main

# Result:
# * feature commits (rewritten)
# * main commits
```

**Use when:**
- Updating your local feature branch with latest `main`
- You want a linear, clean history
- The branch is local-only (not pushed)
- You're the only one working on the branch

### Rebase Workflow

```bash
# Update feature branch with latest main (before PR)
git checkout feature/user-auth
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Fix any conflicts
# Tests should still pass

# Force push (only if you're the only contributor)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-auth
```

Rebase rewrites history, so it breaks work others have based on a branch. Keep it to local, unshared branches. **Guardrail — never rebase a branch that** has been pushed to a shared repository, that others have based work on, that is protected (`main`, `develop`), or that is already merged. For public history, use `git revert` instead.

## Pull Request Workflow

### PR Title Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(auth): add SSO support for enterprise users
fix(api): resolve race condition in order processing
docs(api): add OpenAPI specification for v2 endpoints
```

### PR Description Template

See `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. It contains: What, Why, How, Testing, Screenshots (if applicable), Checklist, linked ticket, ≤300-lines checkbox, and `Closes #<n>`.

### Code Review Checklist

Work each box; the review is done only when every item below is checked or explicitly marked N/A.

**For Reviewers:**

- [ ] Does the code solve the stated problem?
- [ ] Are there any edge cases not handled?
- [ ] Is the code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] Are there sufficient tests?
- [ ] Are there security concerns?
 - [ ] Does the commit history read as a story (one logical change per commit)?

**For Authors:**

  - [ ] Self-review completed before requesting review
  - [ ] CI passes (tests, lint, typecheck)
  - [ ] PR size is ≤300 lines of code and tests
  - [ ] AI commits carry a `Co-authored-by` trailer
- [ ] Related to a single feature/fix
- [ ] Description clearly explains the change

## Conflict Resolution

### Identify Conflicts

```bash
# Check for conflicts before merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth --no-commit --no-ff

# If conflicts, Git will show:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/auth/login.ts
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### Resolve Conflicts

```bash
# See conflicted files
git status

# View conflict markers in file
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# content from main
# =======
# content from feature branch
# >>>>>>> feature/user-auth

# Option 1: Manual resolution
# Edit file, remove markers, keep correct content

# Option 2: Use merge tool
git mergetool

# Option 3: Accept one side
git checkout --ours src/auth/login.ts    # Keep main version
git checkout --theirs src/auth/login.ts  # Keep feature version

# After resolving, stage and commit
git add src/auth/login.ts
git commit
```

### Conflict Prevention Strategies

```bash
# 1. Keep feature branches small and short-lived
# 2. Rebase frequently onto main
git checkout feature/user-auth
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Communicate with team about touching shared files
# 4. Use feature flags instead of long-lived branches
# 5. Review and merge PRs promptly
```

## Branch Management

### Naming Conventions

```
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/JIRA-123-payment-integration

# Bug fixes
fix/login-redirect-loop
fix/456-null-pointer-exception

# Hotfixes (production issues)
hotfix/critical-security-patch
hotfix/database-connection-leak

# Releases
release/1.2.0
release/2024-01-hotfix

# Experiments/POCs
experiment/new-caching-strategy
poc/graphql-migration
```

### Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branches that are merged
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Delete remote-tracking references for deleted remote branches
git fetch -p

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/user-auth  # Safe delete (only if merged)
git branch -D feature/user-auth  # Force delete

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-auth
```

### Stash Workflow

```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash push -m "WIP: user authentication"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/user-auth

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab
```

### Updating a PR with New Changes

```bash
# 1. Make additional changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add error handling"

# 2. Push updates
git push origin feature/user-auth
```

### Syncing Fork with Upstream

```bash
# 1. Add upstream remote (once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# 2. Fetch upstream
git fetch upstream

# 3. Merge upstream/main into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Undoing Mistakes

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo last commit pushed to remote
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Undo specific file changes
git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file

# Fix last commit message
git commit --amend -m "New message"

# Add forgotten file to last commit
git add forgotten-file
git commit --amend --no-edit
```
