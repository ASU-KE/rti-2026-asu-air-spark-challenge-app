# Git Workflow Patterns

For Git configuration, aliases, ignore rules, and hooks, see [`CONFIG-AND-HOOKS.md`](CONFIG-AND-HOOKS.md). For semantic versioning, tags, and changelogs, see [`RELEASES.md`](RELEASES.md).

## Branching Strategies

### GitHub Flow (Simple, Recommended for Most)

Best for continuous deployment and small-to-medium teams.

```
main (protected, always deployable)
  │
  ├── feature/user-auth      → PR → merge to main
  ├── feature/payment-flow   → PR → merge to main
  └── fix/login-bug          → PR → merge to main
```

**Rules:**
- `main` is always deployable
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Open Pull Request when ready for review
- After approval and CI passes, merge to `main`
- Deploy immediately after merge

### Trunk-Based Development (High-Velocity Teams)

Best for teams with strong CI/CD and feature flags.

```
main (trunk)
  │
  ├── short-lived feature (1-2 days max)
  ├── short-lived feature
  └── short-lived feature
```

**Rules:**
- Everyone commits to `main` or very short-lived branches
- Feature flags hide incomplete work
- CI must pass before merge
- Deploy multiple times per day

### GitFlow (Complex, Release-Cycle Driven)

Best for scheduled releases and enterprise projects.

```
main (production releases)
  │
  └── develop (integration branch)
        │
        ├── feature/user-auth
        ├── feature/payment
        │
        ├── release/1.0.0    → merge to main and develop
        │
        └── hotfix/critical  → merge to main and develop
```

**Rules:**
- `main` contains production-ready code only
- `develop` is the integration branch
- Feature branches from `develop`, merge back to `develop`
- Release branches from `develop`, merge to `main` and `develop`
- Hotfix branches from `main`, merge to both `main` and `develop`

### When to Use Which

| Strategy | Team Size | Release Cadence | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| GitHub Flow | Any | Continuous | SaaS, web apps, startups |
| Trunk-Based | 5+ experienced | Multiple/day | High-velocity teams, feature flags |
| GitFlow | 10+ | Scheduled | Enterprise, regulated industries |

## Commit Messages

### Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): update installation instructions` |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change | `style: fix indentation in login component` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | `refactor(db): extract connection pool to module` |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | `test(auth): add unit tests for token validation` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(query): add index to users table` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: add PostgreSQL service to test workflow` |
| `revert` | Revert previous commit | `revert: revert "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login"` |

### Write a specific subject, and a body that explains why

Imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars in the subject; use the body for the reasoning a diff cannot show.

```
# GOOD: specific subject, body explains why
git commit -m "fix(api): retry requests on 503 Service Unavailable

The external API occasionally returns 503 errors during peak hours.
Added exponential backoff retry logic with max 3 attempts.

Closes #123"

# BAD: vague, no context
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

### Commit Message Template

Create `.gitmessage` in repo root:

```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# # Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, revert
# Scope: api, ui, db, auth, etc.
# Subject: imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars
#
# [optional body] - explain why, not what
# [optional footer] - Breaking changes, closes #issue
```

Enable with: `git config commit.template .gitmessage`

## Merge vs Rebase

### Merge (Preserves History)

```bash
# Creates a merge commit
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth

# Result:
# *   merge commit
# |\
# | * feature commits
# |/
# * main commits
```

**Use when:**
- Merging feature branches into `main`
- You want to preserve exact history
- Multiple people worked on the branch
- The branch has been pushed and others may have based work on it

### Rebase (Linear History)

```bash
# Rewrites feature commits onto target branch
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main

# Result:
# * feature commits (rewritten)
# * main commits
```

**Use when:**
- Updating your local feature branch with latest `main`
- You want a linear, clean history
- The branch is local-only (not pushed)
- You're the only one working on the branch

### Rebase Workflow

```bash
# Update feature branch with latest main (before PR)
git checkout feature/user-auth
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Fix any conflicts
# Tests should still pass

# Force push (only if you're the only contributor)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-auth
```

Rebase rewrites history, so it breaks work others have based on a branch. Keep it to local, unshared branches. **Guardrail — never rebase a branch that** has been pushed to a shared repository, that others have based work on, that is protected (`main`, `develop`), or that is already merged. For public history, use `git revert` instead.

## Pull Request Workflow

### PR Title Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(auth): add SSO support for enterprise users
fix(api): resolve race condition in order processing
docs(api): add OpenAPI specification for v2 endpoints
```

- [ ] Related to a single feature/fix
- [ ] Description clearly explains the change

## Conflict Resolution

### Identify Conflicts

```bash
# Check for conflicts before merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth --no-commit --no-ff

# If conflicts, Git will show:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/auth/login.ts
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### Resolve Conflicts

```bash
# See conflicted files
git status

# View conflict markers in file
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# content from main
# =======
# content from feature branch
# >>>>>>> feature/user-auth

# Option 1: Manual resolution
# Edit file, remove markers, keep correct content

# Option 2: Use merge tool
git mergetool

# Option 3: Accept one side
git checkout --ours src/auth/login.ts    # Keep main version
git checkout --theirs src/auth/login.ts  # Keep feature version

# After resolving, stage and commit
git add src/auth/login.ts
git commit
```

### Conflict Prevention Strategies

```bash
# 1. Keep feature branches small and short-lived
# 2. Rebase frequently onto main
git checkout feature/user-auth
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Communicate with team about touching shared files
# 4. Use feature flags instead of long-lived branches
# 5. Review and merge PRs promptly
```

## Branch Management

### Naming Conventions

```
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/JIRA-123-payment-integration

# Bug fixes
fix/login-redirect-loop
fix/456-null-pointer-exception

# Hotfixes (production issues)
hotfix/critical-security-patch
hotfix/database-connection-leak

# Releases
release/1.2.0
release/2024-01-hotfix

# Experiments/POCs
experiment/new-caching-strategy
poc/graphql-migration
```

### Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branches that are merged
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Delete remote-tracking references for deleted remote branches
git fetch -p

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/user-auth  # Safe delete (only if merged)
git branch -D feature/user-auth  # Force delete

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-auth
```

### Stash Workflow

```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash push -m "WIP: user authentication"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/user-auth

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab
```

### Updating a PR with New Changes

```bash
# 1. Make additional changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add error handling"

# 2. Push updates
git push origin feature/user-auth
```

### Syncing Fork with Upstream

```bash
# 1. Add upstream remote (once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# 2. Fetch upstream
git fetch upstream

# 3. Merge upstream/main into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Undoing Mistakes

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo last commit pushed to remote
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Undo specific file changes
git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file

# Fix last commit message
git commit --amend -m "New message"

# Add forgotten file to last commit
git add forgotten-file
git commit --amend --no-edit
```
